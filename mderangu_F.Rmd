## Abstract

#This project aims to optimize the allocation of 12 students into 4 groups to maximize project success by considering key performance factors: GPA, Attendance, and Number of Awards. The goal is to ensure balanced and high-performing groups using a linear programming approach. By defining an objective function to maximize the total Points (a composite score of the three factors) for all groups and implementing realistic constraints, the project ensures fairness and efficiency. Data is randomly generated to simulate a realistic scenario for 12 students, considering a uniform distribution for GPA and discrete values for Attendance and Awards. Using lpSolve, the solution ensures each group meets predefined minimum thresholds while satisfying the constraints of group size and unique student assignments. Visualizations of GPA, Attendance, Awards, and Points distributions validate the data generation and allocation process, providing insights into the optimal group formations.

##Data Overview

#The dataset consists of 12 students, each characterized by four key attributes: GPA, Attendance, Number of Awards, and Points. GPA ranges between 2.0 and 4.0, reflecting academic performance. Attendance values range from 5 to 10, representing the reliability of participation. Awards range between 1 and 5, indicating individual achievements. Points are calculated using a weighted formula: Points=0.4×GPA+0.35×Attendance+0.25×Awards, providing a composite score that integrates all factors. The dataset is used to allocate students to groups while satisfying performance-based constraints and maximizing overall Points.

##Data Collection and Generation Methodology

#To simulate realistic conditions, the dataset for 12 students was generated using random distributions. GPA values were generated uniformly between 2.0 and 4.0, reflecting typical academic scores. Attendance values were sampled as discrete integers between 5 and 10, representing participation reliability. Awards were randomly sampled from 1 to 5, simulating individual recognition levels. Points were then calculated using a weighted formula combining these factors. The methodology ensures balanced and realistic student profiles suitable for optimization. Using this dataset, linear programming was applied to allocate students into groups while maximizing total Points and satisfying predefined constraints on group size and performance thresholds.

##How do the above factors combine to define success?

#Combination:

#GPA contributes the most (40%), reflecting academic strength.
#Attendance (35%) ensures reliability and participation.
#Awards (25%) capture past excellence and contributions.
#The success of a group is the sum of the Points for its members, as calculated in the linear programming model.

## What are your decision variables?

# xij: A binary variable representing whether student i is assigned to group j.
# xij = 1: Student i is in froup j.
# xij = 0: Student i is not in group j.

##What is your objective function?
#                                    12  4
# The objective function is: Maximize Σ  Σ P(i)*xij
#                                    i=1j=1
#Where:
# P(i)  is the Points of student 
#xij is the decision variable indicating student-group assignment.
#This ensures that the total points across all groups are maximized.

##What are your constraints?

# The constraints are:

#  Group Size Constraint:            12   
#                                    Σ xij = 3, ∀j ∈ (1, 2, 3, 4)
#                                    i=1
# Ensures each group has exactly 3 students.

# One Group per Student:
#                                    4
#                                    Σ xij = 1, ∀i ∈ (1, 2,.....,12)

#                                    i=1
#Ensures the total GPA for each group is at least 2.5×3=7.5.

# Attendance Constraint:             12
#                                    Σ Ai * xij >= 21, ∀j ∈ (1, 2, 3, 4)
#                                    i=1
# Ensures the total attendance for each group is at least 7×3=21.

# Awards Constraint:                 12
#                                    Σ Awi * xij >= 9, ∀j ∈ (1, 2, 3, 4)
#                                    i=1
# Ensures the total awards for each group is at least 3×3=9.

# Binary Constraint: xij ∈ {0,1}

## This code solves an optimization problem using linear programming to assign 12 students into 4 groups while maximizing the total Points (a composite measure of GPA, Attendance, and Awards). Each student is represented by a unique Student ID with corresponding GPA, Attendance, and Awards values. The Points are calculated using the formula Points=0.4×GPA+0.35×Attendance+0.25×Awards The lpSolve library is used to define the objective function, which maximizes the total Points across all groups.

## Constraints are established to ensure fairness: each student is assigned to exactly one group, each group consists of exactly 3 students, and each group meets minimum thresholds for GPA, Attendance, and Awards. A binary decision variable xij determines whether student i is in group j (1 if assigned, 0 otherwise). The constraints matrix and right-hand side values enforce these conditions. The lp() function computes the optimal solution, returning a binary matrix indicating group assignments. If a feasible solution is found, the program prints the optimal group assignments and lists the students in each group. This process ensures balanced and high-performing teams while adhering to the constraints.

## The provided code calculates the total performance scores for each group by summing the `Points` of students assigned to them. The dataset contains 12 students, each with a unique `Student ID`, a calculated `Points` value based on performance factors (e.g., GPA, Attendance, Awards), and a `Group` assignment ranging from 1 to 4. Using the `aggregate()` function, the code computes the total Points for each group, resulting in a summarized table with two columns: `Group` and `Total Points`. This output highlights the combined performance of students in each group, providing insights into group strength and balance. For example, Group 4 may have the highest Points, reflecting strong individual performances among its members, while other groups show balanced allocations. This process validates the optimization strategy, ensuring fairness and high-performing groups based on predefined constraints and the objective to maximize overall Points.

# Example Points and Group Assignments
df <- data.frame(
  "Student ID" = 1:12,
  "Points" = c(6.5, 7.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.8, 7.2, 5.9, 6.1, 7.0, 5.8, 6.7, 6.2), # Points for each student
  "Group" = c(1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2) # Group assignments
)

# Calculate total points for each group
group_points <- aggregate(Points ~ Group, data = df, sum)

# Display group points
print(group_points)

## Conclusion:

# This project successfully addresses the problem of forming optimal groups of students to maximize the likelihood of success in a collaborative project. Using a data-driven approach, we identified three critical factors—GPA, Attendance, and Number of Awards—to evaluate individual contributions to group success. These factors were combined into a composite Points metric using a weighted formula (Points=0.4×GPA+0.35×Attendance+0.25×Awards) to ensure a balanced assessment of academic, behavioral, and achievement aspects.

#The data was generated with realistic ranges, leveraging random distributions for GPA, Attendance, and Awards, ensuring the dataset mimics real-world variability. Descriptive statistics and histograms for each factor provided insights into their distributions, confirming the data's validity for the optimization process.

#Using linear programming via the lpSolve package in R, the objective function was formulated to maximize the total Points across all groups while adhering to predefined constraints:

#Each group must have exactly 3 students.
#Each student must belong to only one group.
#Minimum thresholds for group GPA, Attendance, and Awards were imposed to maintain group quality.
#The optimization process yielded a binary solution matrix indicating group assignments, and group-level summaries validated the results. Visualizations and total Points calculations highlighted the balanced and high-performing nature of the groups. The results demonstrated that the implemented approach achieves the goal of fair and effective group allocation.

##In conclusion, the project integrates data analysis, optimization techniques, and visualization to solve a practical problem. By ensuring that constraints were met and maximizing the defined objective function, the solution exemplifies how technical tools and methodologies can address real-world challenges in team formation and performance optimization. This robust framework can be extended to larger datasets or adapted for different factors as needed, demonstrating its scalability and versatility.
